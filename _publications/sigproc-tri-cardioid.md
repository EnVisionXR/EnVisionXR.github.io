excerpt: 'This article analyzes a 2-D planar configuration of three colocated/cocentered cardioids differently oriented azimuthally apart by 120 degrees. For such a coplanar triplet composed of cardioids, the triplet's polar/azimuthal direction-finding Cramer-Rao lower bounds will be analytically derived in closed forms here in this article to exhibit intricate mathematical structures.'
