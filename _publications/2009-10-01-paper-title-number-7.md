Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) has the potential to transform how people build and interact with virtual environments. Within this paper, we discuss potential benefits but also challenges that AIGC has for the creation of inclusive and accessible virtual environments. Specifically, we touch upon the decreased need for 3D modeling expertise, benefits of symbolic-only as well as multimodal input, 3D content editing, and 3D model accessibility as well as foundation model-specific challenges.
