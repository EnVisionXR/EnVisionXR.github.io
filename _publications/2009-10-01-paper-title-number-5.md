title: "Detection thresholds with joint horizontal and vertical gains in redirected jumping"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/vr-redirected-jumping
excerpt: 'We explored joint horizontal and vertical gains that manipulate horizontal and vertical distances at the same time during two-legged takeoff jumping in the virtual space. In a user study, we estimated and analyzed horizontal and vertical detection thresholds.'
