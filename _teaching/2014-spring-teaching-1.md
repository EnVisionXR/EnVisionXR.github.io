This aim of this course is to provide an introduction to the theoretical foundations of Human Computer Interaction, and an understanding of how these can be applied to the design of complex technologies. The supervision covers topics including theory-driven approaches to HCI, design of visual displays, goal-oriented interaction, designing smart, efficient, and meaningful systems, evaluating interactive system designs, and research directions in HCI.
